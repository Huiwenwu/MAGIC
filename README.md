 ############## STEP 1:
 Put all files in the same directory and open the terminal
 
 Input files:
 - 2D peak list
 - 3D peak list
 - PDB file
 - sequence of the construct
 - parameter file (start.txt)
 - magic_v1.0.py
 
 IMPORTANT TIPS: Make sure all files are well formatted according to the exmaple files
 
 ############## STEP 2:
 type the following command:
 
 >python generate.py [2D peak list file name] 
                     [construct sequence file name, fasta format]
                     [labeling, e.g. AILMTV]
                     [starting sequence number, e.g. 48]
                     [CCH short mixing time peak list] - optional
                    
 e.g. python generate.py hmqc.list seq.fasta AILMV 48
 
 Output files:
 - Formated 2D peak list (e.g. new_hmqc.list)
 - Formated methyl list (e.g. seq.auto)
 
 ############## STEP 3:
 
 Edit/verify the 2D peak list (e.g. new_hmqc.list) according to known geminal methyl pairs and methyl types.
 Edit the parameter file (file pathways, labeling and setting parameters)
 
 STANDARD SETTING (see examples of start.txt in Abl_RD):
 ##ppm tolerance (13C,13C,1H):
 0.1 0.1 0.01
 ##score threshold factor:
 1
 ##Distance threshold:
 7 10
 ##Score tolerance for one-by-one step (off or on):
 off
 
 ############## STEP 4:
 
 type the following command to run automatic assignment:
 
 >python Magic_v1.0.py start.txt
 
 ############## Output files:
 
 The generated folder contains three different folder:
 
 - input folder for your record
 - output folder, continuously edited, containing the current assigned 2D and 3D peaklist 
       along with the mapping file to visualize onto the pdb structure the quality 
       of the running assignment
 - run folder, which contains all intermediate files used by the software
